# Vulnerability Assessment Lab

## Overview

This project focuses on setting up a secure and isolated environment for testing and analyzing cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Using a Windows virtual machine (VM) on VirtualBox, we establish a controlled environment to conduct comprehensive vulnerability assessments and analysis. The project utilizes Nessus vulnerability scanner to identify potential security risks and weaknesses, followed by the development and implementation of effective remediation strategies to strengthen system resilience.

## Objectives

- Set up and configure a Windows virtual machine (VM) on VirtualBox to create a secure testing environment.
- Install and configure Nessus vulnerability scanner on the Windows VM for comprehensive vulnerability assessment.
- Conduct vulnerability scans using Nessus, including credential scans, to identify and assess security risks.
- Analyze vulnerabilities in the system by deliberately installing vulnerable software to simulate real-world scenarios.
- Develop and implement effective remediation strategies to minimize potential risks and strengthen system resilience.
### Skills Learned

- Setting up and configuring virtual machines for testing environments.
- Using Nessus vulnerability scanner for comprehensive vulnerability assessment.
- Analyzing vulnerability scan results and identifying security risks.
- Developing and implementing remediation strategies to address vulnerabilities.
- Strengthening system resilience through effective cybersecurity practices.

### Tools Used

- VirtualBox for creating secure and isolated testing environments.
- Nessus vulnerability scanner for comprehensive vulnerability assessment and analysis.

## Steps

### Setting Up Virtual Machines

#### Setting Up the Windows 10 Target Machine:

In this lab, we will configure a Windows 10 machine to serve as our target PC.

The objective is to simulate real-world scenarios by intentionally making the Windows 10 machine vulnerable. This will help us understand the risks associated with improper security configurations.

For guidance on setting up Virtual Machines, refer to this repository [Cybersecurity Labs](https://github.com/acibojbp/Cybersecurity-Labs-Setup).

Making the Windows 10 Machine Vulnerable:

- **Disable Windows Auto Updates:**

    - Navigate to **Settings > Update & Security**.
    - Under Windows Update, select 'Pause updates' and set the duration long enough for the lab session to prevent automatic updates.

- **Uninstall Installed Updates:**

    - In the same **Update & Security** section, go to **Update history > Uninstall updates** and remove each installed update.

- **Turn Off Windows Firewall:**

    - Search for 'Firewall & Network Protection' in the Start menu.
    - Set the firewall state to 'Off' for each profile (Domain, Private, and Public).

Don't forget to restart your machine afterward.

Finally, let's ensure our vulnerable Windows machine and the Nessus machine are connected on the same network. In VirtualBox, I've selected the 'Internal Network' setting for the network adapter and assigned static IPs to both machines. This way, they can communicate with each other safely within their isolated network, without any interference from external sources or even the host system.

For more information on VirtualBox network adapters, refer to the [Virtual Networking documentation](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html).

If you're using Nessus on your host machine, make sure to choose the correct network adapter.

To ensure we're on the same network, give pinging between the machines a try. Remember, the default Windows firewall might block ICMP, so pinging from the vulnerable PC to your host might not work. But if you can ping the vulnerable Windows machine from your host, you're good to go.

I've set up Nessus on a separate virtual machine to keep things neatly virtualized. I went with Ubuntu for this part. Just make sure your IP settings are on point, and set a static IP if necessary.
Once the machines can communicate, we're ready to move forward.
