# Vulnerability Assessment Lab

## Overview

This project focuses on setting up a secure and isolated environment for testing and analyzing cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Using a Windows virtual machine (VM) on VirtualBox, we establish a controlled environment to conduct comprehensive vulnerability assessments and analysis. The project utilizes Nessus vulnerability scanner to identify potential security risks and weaknesses, followed by the development and implementation of effective remediation strategies to strengthen system resilience.

## Objectives

- Set up and configure a Windows virtual machine (VM) on VirtualBox to create a secure testing environment.
- Install and configure Nessus vulnerability scanner on the Windows VM for comprehensive vulnerability assessment.
- Conduct vulnerability scans using Nessus, including credential scans, to identify and assess security risks.
- Analyze vulnerabilities in the system by deliberately installing vulnerable software to simulate real-world scenarios.
- Develop and implement effective remediation strategies to minimize potential risks and strengthen system resilience.
### Skills Learned

- Setting up and configuring virtual machines for testing environments.
- Using Nessus vulnerability scanner for comprehensive vulnerability assessment.
- Analyzing vulnerability scan results and identifying security risks.
- Developing and implementing remediation strategies to address vulnerabilities.
- Strengthening system resilience through effective cybersecurity practices.
